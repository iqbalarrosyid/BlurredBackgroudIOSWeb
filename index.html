          With a strong foundation in website management systems, I have
          hands-on experience in creating websites using React JS as the
          frontend, Express JS as the backend, and Sequelize as the database. I
          believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems, and I
          am committed to contributing to meaningful projects.
          <br />
          My academic journey was complemented by active participation in the
          Rise Academy, where I gained insight into cutting-edge technologies
          and industry best practices. I am on a mission to utilize my skills to
          make a positive impact in the world of software development.
